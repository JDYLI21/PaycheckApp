# PaycheckApp

This discord bot allows users on a waged job to enter the number of hours they have worked and store it in a database.
The user can then retrieve the hours for a specific period and calculate their expected pay.
The user can also delete existing records, update their stats, and use the calculator to simulate their expected pay for a theoretical scenario.
